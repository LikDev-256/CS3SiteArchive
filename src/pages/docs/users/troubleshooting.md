## Backup error
If you are unable to create a backup,

Change/reselect the download location.
	`cs3 > settings > general > download path` and then select a custom location.

## Restore backup error
If you are unable to read the backup file,

Rename the extension of the file from `json to txt`.
	Now try again to read the backup file.

## Error: Out of memory
If the movie doesn't play showing an error saying out of memory,

Change the video cache on disk
	`cs3 > settings > player > video cache on disk` and set a **lower amount of cache**.

## Repositories are not loading in the official site
If the repositories are not loading in [this page](https://cloudstream.cf/repos/),

Try one of these solutions
	- Turn on vpn and reload the page.
	- Try the [rentry page](https://rentry.org/cs3/#repositories).
	- Otherwise try the copy/type method

## Subtitle casting issue
If subtitle isn't casting on the tv with the native casting system,

Try casting using [this app](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.instantbits.cast.webvideo).
	`cs3 > eps page > press and hold the eps > play with Web Video Cast > choose the link` and then cast. *The subtitle selection maybe not as good as cs3.*
