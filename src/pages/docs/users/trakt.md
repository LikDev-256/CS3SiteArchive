âš  The Stremio extension is still experimental. Don't expect a stremio like experience. Most of the public stremio sources are torrent based but cloudstream doesn't support torrent stream. So, none of the popular sources will work here. The below trakt example is link only and it will not play any video. Also, this trakt doesn't sync anything.

1) Install the stremio extension from english repo.

2) Go to <a href="https://2ecbbd610840-trakt.baby-beamup.club/configure" target="_blank">this site</a>

3) Add the lists you want to see in the home section.

4) Click install

5) Copy the link address of the install button that appears again

6) Clone the stremio addon with the link you just pasted

7) At the start of the link, replace `stremio://` with `https://` and remove `manifest.json` from the end of the link
