## For Windows 11 users

- Download and install both of these pieces of software.
	1. [Windows Subsystem for Android](https://apps.microsoft.com/store/detail/windows-subsystem-for-android%E2%84%A2-with-amazon-appstore/9P3395VX91NR?hl=en-us&gl=us)
	2. [WSA Sideloader](https://github.com/infinitepower18/WSA-Sideloader) or [WSA Pacman](https://github.com/alesimula/wsa_pacman)

- Download the pre-release from [this site](https://recloudstream.github.io). 
- Enable developer mode in WSA settings. It is also recommended you enable continuous mode, however WSA Sideloader will attempt to start the subsystem for you if it's not running.

- Give the adb permission to install the apk. *(Make it allow always so that it will give less pain in the future.)*

If you're not in a supported country, change your PC region setting to United States, you should then be able to download Amazon Appstore which contains the subsystem. You can change it back once you have installed it.
